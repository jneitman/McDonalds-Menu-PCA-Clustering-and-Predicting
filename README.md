# McDonald's Menu: Principle Component Analysis, Clustering, and Support Vector Classifiers/Support Vector Machines
This project was submitted as a final deliverable for a data mining class offered through the M.S. Data Science program at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.

The project focuses on past and current items from the McDonald's menu with a goal of calculating and visualizing principle components and clusters (k-means and hierarchical) in relation to nutritional data.  Additionally, support vector classifiers and support vector machines where double cross-validated to obtain a model capable of predicting the category of future items based on its nutritional data.  A support vector classifer (kernel = linear) resulted as the best performing model.  Figures can be viewed in the md file.
