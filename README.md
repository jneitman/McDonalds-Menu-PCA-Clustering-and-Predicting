# McDonald's Menu: Clustering and Predicting
This project was submitted as a final deliverable for a data mining class offered through the M.S. Data Science program at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.

The project focuses on past and current items from the McDonald's menu with a goal of calculating and visualizing clusters (k-means and hierarchical) in relation to nutritional data on an x~y axis.  Additionally, support vector classifiers and support vector machines where double cross-validated to obtain a model capable of predicting the category of future items based of its nutritional data.

## Project Contents
1.  Loading the data and exploratory analysis
2.  Hierarchical clustering
3.  K-mean clustering
4.  Cross-validation and double cross-validation of SVC and SVM
5.  Fitting all data to selected model
