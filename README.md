# McDonald's Menu: Clustering and Predicting
This project was submitted as a final deliverable for a data mining class offered through a M.S. Data Science program at the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire.

The project focuses on past and current items from the McDonald's menu with a goal of organizing and visualizing clusters in relation to nutritional data on an x~y axis.  Additionally, support vector classifiers and support vector machines where double cross-validated to obtain a model capable of predicting the category of future items based of its nutritional data.
